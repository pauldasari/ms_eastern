Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
Effectively utilize ggplot2 for data visualization
Effectively utilize tidyverse functions for data manipulation
Use R to conduct correlation, as well as linear, multiple, and logistic regression
We will use R for Data Science, a free resource.
