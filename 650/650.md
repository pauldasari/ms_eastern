Instructor: Brandi (Henry) Megonigal


Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
Effectively utilize ggplot2 for data visualization
Effectively utilize tidyverse functions for data manipulation
Use R to conduct correlation, as well as linear, multiple, and logistic regression
We will use R for Data Science, a free resource.

### Data Import
- Uses the readr package
- Ref#: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html
Data Transformation
- Code Grade
  install.packages("psych", dependencies = TRUE)
 
 # Module 4 and Module 5
 For Module 4 Model Building: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html
 Module 5: Assumptions
 - Parametric Data - based on probability distribution; it has 4 assumptions
 -  Normal distribution, homogeneity variance, interval data and independence
 ### Normality
 - Assume our sampling distribution is normal
 - Sampling distribution - In theory get a bunch of samples from the population; 
 - def: sampling distribution is the frequency distribution of sample means from the population
 - The sampling distribution mean should be equal to the population mean
 - Central Limit theorem - you have a large enough sample, that the sampling distribution will be normally distributed. 
 - Standard Error of mean - Standard deviation of sample distribution
 ### Checking Assumptions
 - Check based on Graphs, Skew and Kurtosis and Stats
 - Shapiro wilk test i.e. the normtest.W and normtest.p - used for normality
 - if p<0.5(significant) there is an indication the distributions are not normal
 - if p>0.05 distribution not signifcantly different than normal
 ### Homogeneity variance
 - as you go through levels of one variable, the variance of others should not change
 - Us Levene's test 

### Cheat Sheet
Skewness and Kurtosis
 - Positive value - more on left
 - Negative value - more on right
 - Look at skew.2SE and kurt.2SE columns
 >>> greater than 1 significant p <0.05
 >>> greater than 1.29 , p <0.01
 >>> greater than 1.65, p <0.001
Shapiro-Wilk
- P <0.05 - violation
Levene
- p <0.05 - violation

### Violations of Normality
What if things aren't normal
- Remove the case; Transform the data; change the score (next high score plus one; convert back from z-score; the mean +2SDs)

### Visualizing Assumptions
- The main ways to visualize normality is using ggplot and qqplot
- Shapiro-Wilk Test: Compares the scores in the sample to a normally distributed set of scores with the same mean and standard deviation; When significant, it means our sample is signigicantly different than the normal distribution
- When we have a non-significant wilk test and still determine your data are not normally distributed - is a True statement
